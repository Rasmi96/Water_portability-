Water Portability Prediction Project

#Introduction:

Welcome to the Water Portability Prediction project! This project aims to predict the portability of water samples based on various features such as pH levels, dissolved solids, turbidity, and more.

#Project Overview:

The project utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze water quality data and predict whether a given water sample is portable or not. By leveraging historical data and advanced predictive modeling techniques, the system aims to assist in ensuring access to safe drinking water.
