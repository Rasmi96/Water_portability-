Water Portability Prediction Project

Introduction:

Welcome to the Water Portability Prediction project! This project aims to predict the portability of water samples based on various features such as pH levels, dissolved solids, turbidity, and more.

Project Overview:

The project utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze water quality data and predict whether a given water sample is portable or not. By leveraging historical data and advanced predictive modeling techniques, the system aims to assist in ensuring access to safe drinking water.

Project Structure:

Data Collection: Gather water quality data from various sources, including sensors, laboratories, and historical records.
Data Preprocessing: Clean the data, handle missing values, and preprocess features for modeling.
Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features and transform them for improved model performance.
Model Development: Train machine learning models such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or neural networks.
Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Deployment: Deploy the trained model into a production environment for real-time predictions.

Usage:

Data Collection: Obtain water quality data from relevant sources.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data using scripts provided in the repository.
Model Training: Train the predictive model using the prepared data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using evaluation scripts.
Prediction: Use the trained model to predict the portability of new water samples.
